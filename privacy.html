  <h1>Hop Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 04.01.2025</p>

  <p>Hop is a companion application designed to notify you when your Epic Games friends come online. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

  <h2>1. What Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Epic Account ID:</strong> We use your Epic Account ID to identify you and access your Epic Friends list.</li>
    <li><strong>Friend Presence Data:</strong> We may temporarily access and process friend presence (online/offline) to generate real-time notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect anonymous, non-identifiable device data to improve the app and ensure compatibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information solely for the purpose of enabling core features of the Hop app, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticating with Epic Online Services</li>
    <li>Displaying which friends are online</li>
    <li>Notifying you when friends come online</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties. Hop uses Epic Games' Online Services API to access account and presence information, governed by Epic's own privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>Hop does not store or persistently retain your Epic login credentials. Tokens are stored in-memory during runtime only. Any optional settings you configure may be stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or wish to delete your data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@section.solutions">privacy@section.solutions</a>.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as Hop evolves. When we do, we will update the effective date at the top of this page.</p>
